Quarkus - Amazon Lambda with RESTEasy, Undertow, or Vert.x Web
===
As described [Quarkus - Amazon Lambda with RESTEasy, Undertow, or Vert.x Web](https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-lambda-http).
Generated, `mvn install`. Guess what. i wouldn't even compile.
Since this is module is under development i had to adjust the version number.
Consulting [Mvn Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.quarkus/quarkus-core-deployment) showed i should probably change to quarkus v1.2.0.Final.
